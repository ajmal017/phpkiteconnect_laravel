# Zerodha PHP KiteConnect in Laravel

Taken from : https://github.com/zerodhatech/phpkiteconnect made it to use it with laravel

assume your added your file in ```App\Http\Functions``` as a ```KiteConnect.php```

Now you can use it anywhere in your project by adding ```use App\Http\Lib\KiteConnect;``` on top

Do not forget to run ```php artisan cache:clear``` also ```composer dump-autoload``` after adding this!

Thanks,
Happy coding and happy investing!
